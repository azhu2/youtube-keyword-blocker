# youtube-keyword-blocker
Blocks annoying videos from Youtube's homepage since the recommendation engine seems hellbent on making me watch things I don't want to, no matter how many times I tell it no.

This extension works against a blocklist of either keywords or regexes. It hides videos from the Youtube homepage and marks them as 'Not interested'.
